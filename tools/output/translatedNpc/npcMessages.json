It allows you to attack an enemy twice at a time."},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"Red Blood is an elemental stone, Blue Gemstone doesn't have to do the Assassin job at all!"},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"Have you ever seen Mages hunt Elder willow using the Cold Bolt skill? Water overpowers Fire. Water puts Fire under control, and Wind puts water under control."},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"As long as you stick close to the shadows, by walls and things like that, Cloaking will hide you from sight perfectly! Unless some bastard uses a certain detecting skill, you know."},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"'Sharpened Legbone of Ghoul' possesses the Undead property."},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"What kind of weapon have you used so far?

You will need this information someday."},{"npcName":"[Assassin 'Khai']","message":"You can gain a slotted Jur from a buddy living in a dark and damp place under the ground.

You'll understand how this skill works when you reach Level 4 Katar Mastery."},{"npcName":"[The Anonymous One]","message":"^3355FFGrimtooth^000000 allows you to attack enemies while hiding under the ground.

You better speak to the Anonymous One..."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"\" + strcharinfo(0) + \"... You passed the test..?"},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"To be honest, I want to grant you the job change without any other condition. Too many pathetic people don't even have the basic knowledge to be Assassins..."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"We must keep our dignity as Assassins and be truly great! Regrettably, there are too many idiots that don't have any pride."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"All Assassins must respect the enemies they slay, the blood that they spill, and above all, maintain their sense of dignity!"},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Alright. This next trial will test your ability to quickly find your target."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"If you're going to be an Assassin, we need to determine whether or not you can distinguish friend from foe in an instant."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"The main goal of this test is to find and kill as many monsters named ^008800Job change target^000000 as possible."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"You must kill at least 6 ^008800Job change target^000000 monsters. They're intermingled among similar looking monsters, so you need to be careful..."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"If you fail, you'll have to restart this test. Go to the room above me to be transported to the Test Hall."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Only one person is allowed to take the test at a time, so if anyone is taking the test, you'll have to wait until that person finishes."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Hey, don't be too hard on yourself. Cheer up!"},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Hmm, if you're exhausted, I'm willing to bring you back. Of course, if you leave, you'll have to take the job test over again. So what do you want to do?"},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Good choice! Remember, you must find and kill 6 ^008800Job change target^000000 monsters! Good luck!"},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Alright... I guess you could use a break..."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Damn...! You look like you're in a lot of pain. ^666666*Sigh*^000000 Give me a second, let me try to restore your HP and SP..."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"It looks like you're having a tough time. You're either trying too hard, or not trying hard enough, kid."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Hmm. Well, okay. Good luck out there."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Huh... Quit the test, eh? Well, I guess you don't wanna waste any more of our time."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Oh hey, don't forget to save your respawn point in town."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Hey, I'm Thomas. I'm in charge of testing your use of the hiding skill. Think you're up to it?"},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"Listen. In this test, you can't kill any monsters. Your goal is to reach 'Barcardi' at the opposite side of this room."},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"So basically, get to the other side of this room and meet 'Barcardi' without killing a single monster. Understand?"},{"npcName":"[Thomas]","message":"If you run away, get a nose bleed and pass out or something like that, I'll fail ya'. Enough talk. Let's see what you got."},{"npcName":"[Barcardi]","message":"Oh! Congratulations! You may now proceed to our Guildmaster's room. Good luck!!"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Welcome. This place is called the 'Guildmaster's room,' the deepest place in the Assassin guild."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I'm going to give you a simple test. Please find your way through this maze and come to me. It is this maze that protects our guild from intruders."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I look forward to meeting you at the end of maze."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Welcome. I apologize for making you go through the maze."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I saw your resume just now. You're well known as a Thief with guts. Rarely do we receive potential Assassins of your stature."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"May I ask you some questions if you don't mind? You don't have to be nervous. Just remember: if you lie, I will kill you."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"First off, what do you think is the priority of an Assassin?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"More power... Yes, you may think of Assassins as much stronger than Thieves."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"However, for what reason do you wish for more power? To show off? Personal revenge? For what purpose will you use this power?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Why do you want to be stronger than you are now?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Revenge...? Yes, I understand. All of us hold grudges against someone else eventually."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"However, keep in mind that we are not allowed to be emotionally attached. Carry out your duties without question. That is our way."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Being an Assassin means to abandon the ego."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Financial reasons...? I won't deny that we all need money to live. But being Assassin means living for a higher purpose."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Being an Assassin means to abandon such worldly attachments..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Good idea. Traveling around the world will allow you to broaden your experiences."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Most of us tend to avoid gathering into groups though, but I'm sure you already caught that, yes?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"In a way, being an Assassin is to live life in loneliness..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"An Assassin's pride... Did other Assassins tell you that...?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Pride is certainly important, but pride is worth nothing if you do not have any ability."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Most of the Assassins you've met before me are brethren that have shared many difficult times together."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I can understand why their pride and dignity would be so important to them. Now, for what reason do you wish to become an Assassin?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You got the point... We are lonely. We will always be alone, even amongst each other..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"In a way, being an Assassin equals nothing, I would say."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"But, as I told you before, we have comrades. I recommend having at least one comrade to back up you when you're on a mission."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Well, I can't deny it, we do need money to make a living. But don't you think we should pursue something even more important than money?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Style and appearance is only superficial. It is sad that many people think this way..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Such disgraceful Assassins that have lost their true focus are dealt with in our own manner..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Don't forget... Assassins don't toy around. We are not into a style or trend, and we never will be."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Endless Practice... I think you have what it takes. Is there a reason you want to be an Assassin?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Unlike the Thief class, the Assassin job doesn't allow self-indulgence. Tell me the reason you train endlessly."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Learning skills comes naturally with the Assassin job. But don't think of skills as the best value of your training."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You won't be satisfied in becoming an Assassin if you think this..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"It's a goal of yours, eh? Well, I guess you've got to have goals..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I once knew a person who had goals. Long ago, I met someone on assignment who wanted to keep from getting killed before becoming a level 54 knight."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"It's to bad I had to kill him before he was level 52... ^666666*Sigh*^000000 Oh well."},{"npcName":null,"message":"I'm a bit worried about you. I hope you realize that once you become an Assassin, there's no turning back..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Good idea... That is a good way to improve yourself. I've seen many people who know how to be strong physically but not in their mental state."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I hope you're not a hypocrite. Spiritual discipline is the best way for you to survive."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Sadly, there are some nit-wits who are eager to be Assassins even though they don't know anything..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"They cause problems and bring us disgrace. Their activities often result in horrible situations."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Be careful lest you become one of them once you become an Assassin. The responsibility rests solely on your shoulders..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"So if you could become an Assassin right now, what is the first thing you would do?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Hunt... Is that all...?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Don't act recklessly... Being an Assassin never makes you a different person. And don't rely on chance."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"It is good for one to examine oneself. I can understand that you will be excited by the great change in your ability."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"In the meantime, I hope you won't forget the Assassin mentality."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Very well... Exploring places you've never seen before. But know that being an Assassin never makes you a different person."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Don't force yourself too much. Take your time and travel wisely."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Who is waiting for you, might I ask?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I see... Appreciate them for caring about you, even when you're alone."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Great... Comrades for whom you would die for..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"As an Assassin, find a job that you can do for them without them knowing.."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Haha, the needs of the body are sometimes hard to ignore. It's best to accept that part of human nature."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"But you must never reveal to her the Assassin side of your life. No matter what it takes. But you must never reveal to him the Assassin side of your life, no matter what it takes."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Love your beloved forever, even if you can't openly express it. Sometimes, life doesn't allow you to find true love more than once."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"That's most admirable. Is there anything that you would like to ask me about?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"It all depends on your mind. Any place could be the best to level up according to your mind state."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You must know how to survive in any situation."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"There are many Assassins out there. Look to them as your trainers, and ask for their opinions."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I hope you will become an excellent Assassin. And when you reach a certain level, you must guide newbies as your trainers have."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Oh my lord... Are you planning to become an Assassin in order to make money?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"People of that nature are unwelcome. If such is your goal, you may wish to reconsider your job..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"It was nice to meet you. You reminded me of the good ol' days."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Please give me one second..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Those involved with the testing of \" + strcharinfo(0) + \", please gather before me."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"They will be here soon."},{"npcName":"[The Anonymous One]","message":"I am here."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I would like to listen to your opinion of \" + strcharinfo(0) + \" for the job change test."},{"npcName":"[The Anonymous One]","message":"Ah yeah... I think \"+ strcharinfo(0) +\" is decent."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Well... The Anonymous One supports you. How about you, Huey?"},{"npcName":"[Huey]","message":"A rarity. You can tell by the job level."},{"npcName":"[Huey]","message":"I agree with the Anonymous One. Although \"+ strcharinfo(0) +\" looks too mellow and gentle, kind of like a pussycat, \"+ strcharinfo(0) +\" has the stuff."},{"npcName":"[Huey]","message":"If it's alright with you, I'd like to get back to my job."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Yes... That is all, Huey."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"So... 'Beholder,' what is your opinion?"},{"npcName":"[Beholder]","message":"Well, I don't like the course score. But, somehow the whole test was passed. I'm okay with this person."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Hmm... It seems we are all in agreement. Good. I don't have any problem with \"+ strcharinfo(0) +\" as well..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Even though you're driven by personal revenge, I hope it will go away as you train..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Even though your main concern for now is being a rich, I'm sure you'll pursue something even greater..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Eager to travel all around the world, I hope your real identity is found in your journeys..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You seem to know a lot about Assassins. I don't think frustration from being alone will be difficult for you..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You have an idiocy about money, but I believe that you should be able to overcome it."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Although I do not trust you for now, I will give you a chance..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Even though you're enamored with Assassins superficially, I believe you will realize the real value of the Assassin job sooner or later."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"One of the rare people who seeks better skills, I hope you will realize the importance of spiritual discipline sooner or later."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Sooner or later, you will find a new goal to which you can devote yourself..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"I know some people care only about their physical training, but I believe you stand out amongst them..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Well, I've said too much. Please choose a weapon as a present."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You can choose a Jur, Katar, Main Gauche, or a Gladius. As a master, I love them all."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"A Jur... Good choice. There you are. I hope it will serve you well. A Katar... Here you are. Although it's used, I know it will serve you well. I see. You want to use both hands. Here, take your Main Gauche. A Gladius... It used to rule over the Assassin weapon market. Please take care of my gladius."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Well, I talked too much. Please take this first."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Well, I am giving you a token. Please return to the Assassin expert, the Ferocious-Looking Huey, at the entrance."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Upon receiving this token, Huey will promote you to an Assassin."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You, \" + strcharinfo(0) + \", have chosen to live as an Assassin. May you learn our ways and be an honorable example to others."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Okay, all of you may go back to your positions. I will send you to the entrance as well. Let's move..."},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"Umm...? How come you're in here...?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"You already finished your test. Why don't you go try to get the ^006699Necklace of Oblivion^000000 so you can change your job?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"What the hell? You pressed 'Cancel' during the process. Do you want to change your job or what?"},{"npcName":"[Guildmaster]","message":"^666666*Sigh...*^000000 Ok, let's start again. If you don't listen this time, you won't leave this room alive.
